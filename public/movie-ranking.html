<h1>The best movies according to Anushka</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Train to Busan</h3>
<p>It's my favourite south korean zombie thriller that combines intense action and emotional depth.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>AS an engineer,this movie is an emotion. A comedy-drama that questions India's education system. </p>
<h3>Triangle</h3>
<p>It's suspenseful horror thriller movie that plays with time loops and the concept of fate.</p>
